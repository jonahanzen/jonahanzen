#  Hello there! Welcome :wave:

In October (2021), i finished a Fullstack Bootcamp focused in Java for Web development, from where i also joined College, a Bachelor in Software Engineering. ( And i really started loving Java. )
Since then, I'm heavily focusing on courses, projects that i 'post' on Github, and reading.

You could say that I'm in an 'Epic' to be a very articulate developer / engineer, and in that context, my actual 'Story' as of now, is to learn tools and frameworks that integrate with Java such as the Spring Framework, or to better understand Databases such as Mongo and SQL Server.

The "Big idea" here is to reach a level of knowledge that will make me solve harder problems while making me struggle a bit less in them, and to not only have a foundation level of even legacy tools, but also to be very updated in the newer ones.
